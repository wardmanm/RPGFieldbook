# Unreleased

Running notebook of changes made since the last release. `APP_VERSION` stays at the last **released**
version while you work — nothing here is versioned yet.

**Add a `- ` bullet for every player-visible change as you make it.** One bullet per change, written
the way it should read in the changelog (players see these). Text can wrap onto continuation lines.

Bullets are copied VERBATIM into three places that render differently, so:
- **No angle brackets.** `<name>` is an HTML tag on GitHub and disappears from the release notes.
- **No literal version numbers** — they go stale the moment the version is bumped.
- `**bold**` renders on GitHub and in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, but shows as literal asterisks in the
  app's own What's New list, which escapes its text. Use it sparingly.

When you are ready to cut a release, run one of:

```
./build.sh --release patch     1.2.1 -> 1.2.2   bug fixes
./build.sh --release minor     1.2.1 -> 1.3.0   new features
./build.sh --release major     1.2.1 -> 2.0.0   breaking rework
./build.sh --release 2.0.0     an explicit version
```

That bumps `APP_VERSION`, moves every bullet below into a new `CHANGELOG` entry in
`src/js/30-version.js`, empties this list, and then builds. A release fails if this list is empty.

Bullets below this line — leave the heading in place.

## Pending

- Attacks can now carry additional damage types. A sword that deals 1d8 slashing and 1d6 poison is
  one attack: add as many extra dice as you need in the attack form, and they show on the sheet, in
  the to-hit breakdown and on the printed sheet. Extras roll on their own — the ability modifier and
  any damage bonuses stay on the main damage.
- Rules pack names containing an ampersand no longer show their escape code in the glossary heading.
